# ANN-practice

Project description:
Complex physical system can be modeled as a combination of systems with different behaviors. These behaviors are called modes. The goal of this project is to identify the current operation mode using only the observed data, without knowledge of any system model.  Identify the correct mode is critical to guarantee the desired performance in any situation.

Project implementation :
Starting from a dataset of measurements obtained from the system, you will compare the classification performance of different neural networks when applied to sequential data. In particular, you will try to implement a classifier using diffent algorithms. 

For example: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
